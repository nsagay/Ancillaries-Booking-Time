Item Sales and Booking Trends: The number of bookings and items sold showed a steady increase throughout the year, peaking around mid-2019.

Top-Selling Item: Baggage was the most frequently booked item across all services, reflecting a strong demand for luggage transportation.

Booking Lead Time: The majority of bookings for all items were made within 0-2 days of travel, indicating that customers often make last-minute arrangements. This is particularly true for baggage and bikes.

Bookings by Day Type: Most bookings occurred during weekdays, with a noticeable dip in bookings during weekends, especially for bikes and group baggage.

Pricing Proposal for Bikes:

Demand Pattern: Bike transportation had lower booking volumes compared to baggage but followed a similar trend of last-minute bookings. Additionally, the demand was relatively higher during weekends, possibly due to leisure trips.
Proposed Pricing Strategy: Introduce dynamic pricing for bike transportation, offering discounted rates for early bookings (beyond 7 days). A higher price can be charged for last-minute bookings (0-2 days) to capitalize on urgent needs. Weekend demand could also be boosted with special weekend pricing to incentivize travelers.

## Conclusion
By analyzing booking patterns, day-type preferences, and lead times, we have identified opportunities to adjust pricing strategies, especially for the bike transportation product. Introducing dynamic and weekend-based pricing could optimize revenue and meet customer demands more effectively.
